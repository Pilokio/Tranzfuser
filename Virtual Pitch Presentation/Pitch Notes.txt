Slide 1 - Parkour

CyberFocus is set in the future where players play as a Cyborg which gives them the ability to wall run and other ways of overcoming challenges.

One of the main features of the game is the ability to parkour. By having this mixed with gunplay, we beleive
it creates a fun and creative way for players to approach different scenarios and choose.

We have also come up with a hook mechanic which allows players to hook to specific points to gain an advantage over their enemies.
Having this alongised fats paced wall running is what we beleive will make the levels more creative and fun for players.

Slide 2 - Time Control

Time control is the biggest feature of our game. Slow motion can capture exhilirating events like dodging bullets and manouvering around enemies 
will be exiting and a breath of fresh air for players, especially mixed with parkour.
