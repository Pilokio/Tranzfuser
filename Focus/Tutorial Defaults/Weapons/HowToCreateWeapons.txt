To create a new weapon, add one in the assets folder via Right-click > Create > Weapon.

Click on the new Weapon Asset that has just been created, to assign the weapon's values in the inspector.

The values are as follows:
-	Weapon Name: used to visually display the currently equipped weapon in the UI.
-	Type: the current weapon type (e.g. pistol, launcher, etc.).
-	Weapon Object: the weapon prefab (the game object used to visually represent this weapon).
-	Weapon Damage: The base level of damage that this weapon will inflict.
-	Weapon Range: how far the raycast will reach/how far the physical bullet will travel before being destroyed. 
-	Impact Force: The force applied to physics objects being shot by this weapon. Launchers use this value as the explosion force.
-	Weapon Fire Rate: fire rate of the weapon between 0 and 1.
	o	1 is ideal for large intervals between shots such as snipers.
	o	0.1 is for fully automatic weapons as the interval between shots is near instant.(0 would not be recommended).
	o	0.5 is ideal for semi-automatic weapons as it provides a medium sized interval between shots.
-	Weapon Ammo Type: the type of ammo that will be consumed when firing the weapon.
-	Weapon Mag Capacity: the number of shots that can be fired before a reload is needed.
-	Weapon Ammo Loaded: the amount of ammunition currently loaded into the gun.
-	Spawn Ammo: This determines if and when a physical projectile should be spawned when the weapon is fired
	o	Always results in the projectile being spawned in whenever the weapon is fired.
	o	Slow Mo Only results in a projectile being spawned only when slow motion is active.
	o	Never means that a projectile will never be spawned when the weapon is fired.
-	Ammo Object: the bullet prefab for this weapon that will be spawned in.
-	Bullet Force: the amount of force that the bullet will be fired with.

Add the weapon asset you have just created to the desired character's weapon controller component.

Assuming the character is setup to use the weapon controller properly, it should be good to go.
