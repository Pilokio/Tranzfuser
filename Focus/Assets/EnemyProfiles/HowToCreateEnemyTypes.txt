Swiftness: affects movement speed etc.
Success Chance: affects how accurate the enemy will be with their weapons.

Base Max Health: the amount of health the enemy will have before being multiplied by their difficulty rating.
Has Tank Behaviour: if this is selected, the enemy will alternate between moving towards the player, 
		    and stopping to shoot at them. Otherwise, the normal decision making is carried out.

Default Detection Angle: the cone of vision angle used when in the idle state, increased by 90 when suspicious or hostile.
